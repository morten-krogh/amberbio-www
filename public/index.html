<h3>Amber BioSciences - a bioinformatics company</h3>
<p>
We provide bioinformatics and statistics consulting to biotech
companies and university researchers.  Modern biomedical research
requires use of statistics, mathematical algorithms and computer
programs in the design and analysis of experiments. Every project
  has its own distinct features that require customized design,
work flow, software and analysis.
</p>
<p>
We collaborate closely and personally with our customers, who might or might not
  have prior bioinformatics skills.
Examples of our services are given on the
<a href="products.html">products</a> page.
</p>
<p>
With a location in Lund, Sweden, Amber BioSciences, founded by Swedish and Danish
  bioinformaticians, is part of the active Medicon Valley research
community and close to biotech companies and universities in both
Sweden and Denmark. We provide services globally in the languages
  English, Swedish and Danish.
